                                    To get you to know me better, Iâ€™m a graduate of BS in Information Technology at 
                                    Mindanao State University Iligan Institute of Technology with latin honors. 
                                    You always found me in front of a computer - coding, playing, watching videos, 
                                    or reading articles about scientific discoveries or trends in tech. Other than that, 
                                    I also love cooking and going for a walk, jogging, swimming, and cycling. 
                                    My passion for technology sparked when my cousins and I played console games during my 
                                    primary school years. However, programming comes during my junior high school in a single 
                                    laboratory which is adding two integers. Since then I aspire to be a software engineer/developer 
                                    and aim to be part of big tech companies.
